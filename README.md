# readify-knockknock

This repository is my implementation of the readify knock knock solution.

To get going:

- Clone the repo
- `npm install` to grab the dependencies
- Copy the sample `config.json` from `sample_config` folder into the apps root folder
- Edit the config to define the host IP and port to bind to.
- `node app.js` to run the web service.
